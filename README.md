# Fine-Grained-Image-Classification

Repository for the Competition hosted at the end of the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" A.Y. 2023/2024 from the Master of Science in Data Science of the University of Trento.

The repository will be filled with different models in order to obtain the one with the highest performance (Accuracy).

All the files contained in /Image_preparation/ and /Dataset_classes/ were done before discovering the .resize, .crop, etc... already available in Pytorch, so they will stay in the folder but won't be used in the models. The Notebooks were written using the Pytorch methods already available.
