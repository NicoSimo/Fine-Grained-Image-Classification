-Created CNN_FGVC.ipynb, a model built on the FGVC dataset.
    - It uses a CNN built from "scratch" 

  ---> first problem, images of different size. 
  - Created 'Cropper.py' 'Library'. It contains two functions. The first one is designed to take a dataset (folder) of images in input and return the average size (height and width),
    while the second one takes the same dataset, the avg sizes and returns the dataset resized to the proper size.
